## 2 Gartner 2018 Magic Quadrant for High-Productivity Application Platform as a Service

Mendix was recognized as a leader in high-productivity-application-platform-as-a-service (hpaPaaS), placed furthest for completeness of vision for two years running.

Here's what the Gartner report states about Mendix:

<blockquote><p>Mendix is an established (2005) pure-play, low-code hpaPaaS provider offering cloud-native architecture and  capabilities. The Mendix Web Modeler together with the Atlas UI framework offers both professional developers and, to a lesser degree,  citizen developers interested in high-productivity, a model-driven  visual development environment generating metadata that is interpreted at runtime. Mendix also offers an additional integrated development  environment (IDE) for professional developers to complement and extend  the low-code development tools. Mendix's low-code modeling tool supports  sophisticated data-driven, event-driven and process-oriented applications.</p>

<p>Mendix is deployed on AWS and supports Cloud Foundry and Docker images. The company has  distribution partnerships with SAP and IBM. Mendix is investing heavily in growing its business and has 4,000 customers using its free community  edition.</p></blockquote>

## 3 The Forrester Wave™: Low-Code Development Platforms For AD&D Pros, Q4 2017

A Forrester survey of IT leaders reveals that low-code development platforms speed up application delivery, dramatically improving IT’s ability to respond to business demands.

Here's what the Forrester report states about Mendix:

<blockquote><p>Mendix is firing on all cylinders and about to accelerate its distribution. A well-known low-code platform for AD&D pros, Mendix continues to innovate in new use cases and deepen its features across the board. Its decision to base its low-code environment on Cloud Foundry also paid big dividends, as SAP—a Cloud Foundry distributor—adopted the vendor's platform as its worldwide low-code solution. That partnership is the first by one of the four largest enterprise vendors (IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP) with a low-code platform vendor and should accelerate Mendix's already substantial growth.</p>

<p>Mendix has many strengths in addition to its new SAP relationship: The platform's user experience (UX) and content/collaboration services tooling, its development-team support and administration tooling, and its cloud service and developer community are all outstanding. Mendix has leading AI and machine-learning development features, and offers a specific tool to include business developers in app-delivery projects. Mendix shows weakness in cloud security certifications, and breadth of partner roster, and some advanced reporting and process features.</p></blockquote>

## 4 Gartner 2018 Magic Quadrant for Mobile App Development Platforms

According to Gartner, by 2022, citizen developers will be building more than a third of all web and mobile employee-facing apps delivered in organizations with mature citizen development initiatives (Gartner Inc., “Market Guide for Rapid Mobile App Development Tools,” November 30, 2017, Jason Wong).

Here's what this Gartner report states about Mendix:

<blockquote><p>Mendix is again a Leader. Its MADP offers strong support for multiple developer personas, with a focus on model-driven, high-productivity development. Mendix has over 750 paying customers, mostly SMBs. Many of these have been customers for a long time, but Mendix's base of enterprise customers has been growing faster in recent years.</p>

<p>The Mendix platform is cloud-based, with a large percentage of its customers operating in the public cloud. The Mendix Web Modeler development tool enables visual development of simple apps, rapid prototyping, and collaboration between citizen and professional developers. For professional development, there is Mendix's Desktop Modeler, a rich-client IDE that supports high-productivity development with more extensibility options for the developer. A key aspect of Mendix Web Modeler and Desktop Modeler is that there is bidirectional app collaboration and creation capability, including a portal for managing the development life cycle. This enables better collaboration and encourages continuous improvement within blended teams. Mendix's back-end services offer SDKs for development of apps outside Web Modeler and Desktop Modeler.</p></blockquote>

## 5 The Forrester Wave™: Mobile Low-Code Development Platforms, Q1 2017

Based on an assessment of the current offerings, strategy, and market presence of 11 vendors, Mendix was named a leader in The Forrester Wave™: Mobile Low-Code Development Platforms, Q1 2017.

Here's what this report states about Mendix:

<blockquote><p>Mendix combines feature breadth with mobile features enterprises need. Mendix is an 11-year-old company founded in the netherlands and now headquartered in the US. Mendix builds its product on cloud Foundry, although it’s fully abstracted from the low-code developer’s purview. the Mendix platform includes mobile capabilities that are frequently sought by tech management teams, such as an embedded enterprise app store, flexible deployment options, and broad reporting capabilities. Mendix makes extensive use of declarative tooling to create and deliver applications and drive integration. Mendix also offers a generous free-access program to help customers get started with the platform. one customer reference has built more than 60 apps in the last two years, which would have been impossible with traditional development tools and the resources on staff.</p>

<p>The Mendix platform has a few functional weaknesses, the most glaring of which is its lack of security certifications. Mendix relies too heavily on the security certifications of its cloud-platform partners. Also, the vendor’s size ($25 million – $50 million in revenue) gives pause to some global enterprises. Still, Mendix has about 500 customers, including large enterprises.</p></blockquote>
