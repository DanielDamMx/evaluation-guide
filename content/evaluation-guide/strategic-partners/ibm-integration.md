### 1.1 How Can I Run & Deploy My Application on IBM Cloud?

IBM has integrated the provisioning and deployment of Mendix applications directly into the IBM Cloud. This is done using the IBM Toolchain and CI/CD pipeline integration.

For more details, see the section [How Can I Run Mendix on IBM Cloud?](../app-capabilities/strategic-partner-cloud#ibm-cloud) in *Strategic Partner Clouds*.

## 2 Which IBM Services Can I Use Within Mendix? {#ibm-services}

In principle, there are no limitations on consuming any service from IBM Cloud. However, together with IBM, Mendix has created some out-of-the box connectors that accelerate development on top of the services even more.

These are the services available as connectors:

 * [IBM Watson Connector Suite](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/2860/) (a collection of connectors for IBM Watson cognitive services)
 * [IBM Mobile Analytics Widget](https://appstore.home.mendix.com/link/app/106305/)
