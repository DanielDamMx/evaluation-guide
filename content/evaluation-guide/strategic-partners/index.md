Mendix has strategic partnerships with both SAP and IBM.

SAP has adopted the Mendix Platform as their own rapid application development platform for extending their solutions. The SAP Solution Extension partnership means you can not only purchase Mendix from SAP directly, but integrate Mendix with SAP in a variety of ways, take advantage of a single point of contact for support, and build Mendix apps on top of SAP.

Mendix is the standard low-code development platform to be used on top of IBM Cloud. This means you can utilize IBM as a single contact for using Mendix on IBM Cloud.

Discover all the details of these exciting partnerships in the chapters below.
