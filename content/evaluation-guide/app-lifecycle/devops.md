Mendix provides DevOps tools out of the box for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), test automation, and monitoring (among other services) so that your development team can embrace the DevOps way of working. Your team can rapidly build, test, release, and maintain applications in production environments more autonomously with Mendix while ensuring compliance with your enterprise requirements. They can also use the Mendix Platform APIs to support direct integration with your existing CI/CD pipeline.

## How Does Mendix Support DevOps? {#support}

With one-click deployment and out-of-the-box monitoring, the Mendix Platform enables small cross-functional teams working iteratively to rapidly build, test, release, and operate enterprise applications in production environments. Teams can continuously release new functionality to the cloud for automated testing before using two-factor authentication to push updates to live production environments. All of this is carried out under the strict security controls and governance set out by your enterprise requirements.
